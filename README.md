## What to Follow When Downloading the Project

If you clone this project directly, it may not work fully. For the application to work properly, you need to complete some configuration steps. In particular, you need to correctly add **API keys** that are critical to the project.

### Required API Keys and Configuration

The API keys needed for the application to run are stored in the `appsettings.json` file. These keys must be unique to you; otherwise the application will not work as expected.

Below you can see an example structure of the `appsettings.json` file:
```json
{
  "Authentication": {
    "Supabase_Url": "Your_Supabase_URL",
    "Supabase_Key": "Your_Supabse_KEY",
    "Supabase_Service_Role": "Your_Supabase_ROLE",

    "SendGrid_ApiKey": " Your_Twilio_SendGrid_API_KEY",

    "Weather_BaseUrl": "https://weather.visualcrossing.com/VisualCrossingWebServices/rest/services/timeline/{0}?key={1}&unitGroup=metric",
    "Weather_ApiKey": "Your_Visual_Crossing_API_KEY",

    "Ip_Api_Url": "http://ip-api.com/json"
  },

  "BackgroundImageURLs": {
    "clear-day-background": "https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/sun-flare_74190-1494.jpg",
    ...
  },

  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },

  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

### Data Storage and Encryption

Two different JSON files are created in the project:
1. `WeatherData.json`
    - Stores detailed weather data for the registered city.
    - Location:
      ```swift
      C:/Users/UserName/AppData/Local/WeatherZeroPlus/WeatherData.json
      ```
2. `ApplicationActivityData.json`
    - Keeps a record of the user's in-app activities.
    - Since it contains the user's e-mail and password, it is stored in encrypted form as a security measure.
    - Location:
      ```swift
      C:/Users/UserName/AppData/Local/WeatherZeroPlus/ApplicationActivityData.json
      ```
These files are used to personalize the app's user experience and securely manage session information.

#### Important Notes

- Do not share your API keys with anyone and do not add your `appsettings.json` file to version control (Git).
- If you enter the API keys incorrectly, the application may not work as expected.
- The contents of `ApplicationActivityData.json` are encrypted and cannot be read or accessed from outside.

[G√∂revler](https://www.notion.so/1531fb14c4a880c29cd1e8274f998d62?pvs=21)

## Project Planning and Design üé®

The data to be displayed:

- Temperature (in Celsius),
- Nem,
- Wind,
- Precipitation

The number of cities to be monitored simultaneously can be up to three.

The notification system will stably notify you about the weather in the selected primary city every 5 hours. The notification includes basic information about the temperature and weather. In addition, the user will be able to customize the notification frequency.

The user interface is based on a simple design principle.  There is a UI element that shows the date and time, as well as a search bar that allows the user to find out the weather information of the cities by searching for the location. Temperature, pressure, humidity and wind data are displayed. It also has a timeline that will follow the sunset and sunrise of the user. It is used in a structure that lists the weather conditions in the coming days. There is a button for additional settings and account information for the user. With this button, the user will be able to access additional features.

## Technological Infrastructure Selection ‚òëÔ∏è

LTS versions above .Net 6 or 7 were preferred for development. Because it was taken into consideration that future-oriented development and the possibility of encountering problems were low.

The UI Framework to be used was WPF. Being both modern and up-to-date will facilitate the development process.

OpenWeatherMap was preferred as the data source. Thus, we can access the data more economically and easily. If there is any contrary situation, we can use the Visual Crossing Weather tool.

    - **Answer:** The app shows the weather for all cities accessible via the Visual Crossing Weather API.
- **Question 2:** How do notifications work?
    - **Answer:** Notifications are sent at set intervals (5 hours by default) for the user's selected primary city. The notification frequency can be changed in the settings menu.
- **Question 3:** How often are data updates done?
    - **Answer:** Data is pulled from the API every 5 hours. The application pulls the weather data from the JSON data it previously saved in the 5-hour period.
- **Question 4:** Does the application work without internet connection?
    - **Answer:** The app requires an internet connection to pull weather data. However, the cached data can be viewed without an internet connection.
- **Question 5:** How accurate is the data?
    - **Answer:** The app shows the weather for all cities accessible through the OpenWeatherMap and Visual Crossing Weather APIs. While these services are highly accurate for large and important cities, they can be inaccurate for smaller cities.
- **Question 6:** How many cities can we register?
    - **Answer:** The application allows you to register up to 3 cities.
- **Question 7:** Can we delete an account?
    - **Answer:** You can completely remove your account through the application. You will not have any stored data.
- **Question 8:** What should I do if I forgot my password?
    - **Answer:** You can change the password of your account through the application.
- **Question 9:** Are there certain rules for setting a password?
    - **Answer:** Yes, there are some rules that your password must follow when registering or entering the password. These rules are
      - Your password must be at least 8 characters.
      - Your password must contain at least two capital letters.
      - Your password must contain at least two numbers.
      - Your password must contain at least two special characters. *(For example: !, @, #, +, -, etc.)*
